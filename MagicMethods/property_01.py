Thw problem with this approach is backward compactibility

This code works just fine. But it has a backward compatibility issue.
Suppose you released the Person class for a while and other developers 
have been already using it. And now you add the getter and setter, 
all the code that uses the Person wonâ€™t work anymore.

To define a getter and setter method while achieving backward compatibility,
 you can use the property() class.

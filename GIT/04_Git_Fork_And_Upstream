Assume you'va have a opensource project called - Pythonista (Where you don't have direct push access)

you can clone Pythonista using either clone or fetch command.

Goto Pythonista github project and click on fork

Assume it is forked to daya/learn_python

Problem is:
===========
Once you're cloned the repo, there are no upstream set for cloned repo(daya/learn_python)
hence your cloned copy is not sync with Pythonista repo and missing out lot of commits.

To Address above issue:
=======================

set upstream in the cloned repo.

git remote -v # To view all the remotes
by default , you won't see upstream for forked repos.

Add upstream by
git remote add upstream <pythonista_git_url>

#fetch all the latest code using fetch
git fetch upstream # upstream is just lika a alias to Pythonista project

Merge upstream branch to local branch:
======================================
Assume you're on 'feature-1' branch on local

git merge upstream/feature-1 feature-1

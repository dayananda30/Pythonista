Before you generate ssh key, you can check if there are any existing keys

ls -al ~/.ssh

By default the filenames of the public keys are one of the following
id_dsa.pub
id_ecdsa.pub
id_ed25519.pub
id_rsa.pub

we can copy the content of id_*.pub to github or bitbucket

if keys are not listing in above directory then use ssh-keygen

ssh-keygen -t rsa -c "dayananda30@gmail.com"

Ensure your ssh-key is added to the ssh-agent. Start the ssh-agent in the background if it's not running already.
$eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

ssh key-add private-key

If you want to chnage the upstream of an existing project from HTTPS to SSH , run below command
git remote set-url origin ssh://git@bitbucket.server.com:<port>/organisation/project.git

ssh -T git@github.com # will add github.com to known hosts

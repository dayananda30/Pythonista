Problem Statement:
------------------
I have two machines - local setup and jumpbox(where everyone has access for jumpbox)
I have created public and private key pair and addded public key content to github profile.
added private key to ssh-agent and able to clone using ssh.

ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -C dayananda30@gmail.com
cat id_rsa and copy content to github profile
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-add -l #list


what if I want to clone in Jumpbox?
I cannot copy paste my public and private keys inside kumpbox as it is shared by people.

one way we can achieve this by agent forwarding:
ssh -A jumpbox
-A passes keys over the session
you can clone the repo because -A supplies local keys to Jumpbox
ssh-add -l should list key

Otherway - ~/.ssh/config
-------------------------
Host Jumpbox
    Hostname 192.x.x.x.
    user dayananda30

Host Jumpbox-with-keys
    Hostname 192.x.x.x
    user dayananda
    ForwardAgent: Yes

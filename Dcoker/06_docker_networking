Docker Networking:

    - When a docker is created, it creates a default network called bridge network.
    - which is internal private IP addresses , usually starts with 172.17 subnet range.
    - You can map container ports to host ports for exposing these containers to external world.

Bridge Network:
    - By default, Docker creates only one network.
    - We can create our custom network using docker network command.
    - docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 182.18.0.0/16 custom-network
    - docker network ls
    - docker inspect <container name> to view IP address.

Embedded DNS:
    - Docker has build in DNS server running on 127.0.0.11

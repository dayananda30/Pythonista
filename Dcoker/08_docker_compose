Assume we have a voter application with following components
    - voting app - python
    - In Memory database - redis
    - worker - . NET
    - postgress SQL
    - result app - Node JS

    - We can run each of the images separately but dependent containers are not linked. ex: voting app and redis db.
    - we can link two containers using --link parameter like below
        - docker run -d --name=redis redis
        - docker run -d --name vote -p 5000:80 --link redis:redis voting-app

    Note: links will be deprecated in future from docker.

Docker Compose:
    redis: ==> Name of the Container
        image: redis  ==> Image to be used
    db:
        image: postgress:9.4
    vote:
        image: voting-app
        ports:
            - 5000:80 ==> ports to be mapped
        links: ==> mention the dependent service
            - redis:

docker-compose up to bring entire application stack.

If I want build locally instead of pulling the images then i need to replace image with build like below
    worker:
        build: ./workerDockerfile
        ports:
            - 6000:90

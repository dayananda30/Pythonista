why user should be added to docker group?
-----------------------------------------
Adding a user to the Docker group on a Linux system allows that user to run Docker commands without needing to prefix them with sudo.
By default, Docker requires root or sudo privileges to execute commands because it interacts with system resources that are typically restricted to administrators.
Adding a user to the Docker group grants them the necessary permissions to manage Docker containers, images, and other resources.
This can be convenient for developers or administrators who frequently work with Docker and want to avoid typing sudo before every Docker command.

However, it's important to note that granting a user membership in the Docker group effectively gives them root-level access to the Docker daemon.
This means they can potentially manipulate Docker resources and containers, which could be a security risk.
Therefore, it's generally recommended to add trusted users to the Docker group who require regular Docker access.

It's important to exercise caution when granting permissions and consider the potential security implications of adding users to the Docker group.

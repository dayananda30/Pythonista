How to add certificates in linux and why it is needed?
------------------------------------------------------
To add certificates in Linux, you can follow these general steps:

    1. Identify the certificate format: Determine the format of the certificate you want to add.
       Certificates can be in various formats such as PEM (.pem), DER (.der), or PFX/PKCS12 (.pfx/.p12).

    2. Choose the appropriate location: Decide where to store the certificate.
       Linux systems typically have system-wide certificate stores, such as `/etc/ssl/certs/`, or user-specific stores, such as `~/.ssl/certs/`.
       You may need administrative privileges (`sudo`) to add certificates to system-wide locations.

    3. Copy or move the certificate: Copy or move the certificate file to the chosen location.
       For example, if you have a certificate file named `example.crt` and you want to add it to the user-specific store, you could use the following command:
        ```
            cp example.crt ~/.ssl/certs/
        ```

    4. Update the certificate store: Depending on the Linux distribution and certificate management system used, you might need to update the certificate store manually.
       Some systems automatically detect changes, while others require running specific commands to update the store.
       For example, on Ubuntu, you can update the certificate store with the `update-ca-certificates` command:
        ```
            sudo update-ca-certificates
        ```

Why it is needed?
-----------------
Certificates play a crucial role in establishing secure communication over networks, such as HTTPS connections.
They provide a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of the parties involved in the communication. Here are some reasons why certificates are needed:

    1. Secure communication: Certificates enable encryption and secure communication between clients and servers.
       They ensure that data transmitted between them remains confidential and protected from eavesdropping or tampering.

    2. Authentication: Certificates serve as a means of authentication.
       They validate the identity of the server to the client, assuring the client that it is communicating with the intended and trusted server.

    3. Trust establishment: Certificates are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) who vouch for the authenticity of the entities they certify.
       Adding certificates to the system allows it to establish trust in the entities and validate their certificates.

    4. Secure web browsing: Web browsers rely on certificates to verify the identity of websites and protect users from visiting malicious or fraudulent sites.
       Adding certificates to the system ensures that browsers can properly validate websites.

By adding certificates to Linux systems, you enable secure communication, establish trust in the entities involved, and enhance overall system security.

What are docker repository keys?
--------------------------------
In the context of Docker, repository keys (also known as Docker registry keys or Docker repository signing keys) are
cryptographic keys used for verifying the authenticity and integrity of Docker images and repositories.

These keys play a crucial role in ensuring that the Docker images you pull or push are from trusted sources and have not been tampered with.

Docker repositories can be signed with OpenPGP keys, specifically with GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) keys. When a Docker image is signed,
it means that it has been cryptographically associated with a specific key.
By verifying the signature of a Docker image using the corresponding repository key, you can be reasonably confident that the image has not been modified or replaced since it was signed.

Repository keys are usually provided by the maintainers or publishers of Docker images or repositories.
Docker clients, such as the Docker engine or Docker command-line interface, have built-in functionality to verify signatures using repository keys.

To verify a Docker image's signature, Docker clients use the repository key associated with the image's repository.
If the key is not present on the local system, the client may need to fetch the key from a trusted key server or other sources specified by the repository.

By verifying Docker image signatures with repository keys, users can have greater assurance about the authenticity and
integrity of the images they use, helping to protect against potential security risks or compromised images.
